# Dealer Customer Data Clustering
This project is an implementation for clustering customer dealer data. The goal of this project is to seperate dealer data based on relevant features. This project was made for Machine Learning Course which utilizied K-Means Clustering. 

# Key Points
1. Data Visualization.
2. Data Analysis.
3. Data Preprocessing.
4. Clustering with K-Means Algorithm from Scracth.
5. Evaluated K-Means Result.

# Installation and Usage
At the beginning, you can clone this repository and you have to make sure that your machine has been installed with Python (3.11.4) and PIP (23.2.1). It is recommended for using virtual environment (venv). Inside the project you can do

python -m venv env
```
After that, make sure your env is active. Command bellow i used in windows terminal (cmd) for activing my environment
```bash
env\Scripts\activate
```
If your env is active, then you can install all depedencies from the requirements.txt
